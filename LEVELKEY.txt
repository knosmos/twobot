Levels are constructed in layers, with the bottom layer first and top layer last,
separated by three hyphens (---) and a newline. Each layer is a two-dimensional map, where each character
represents a single block. The following key is the mapping of characters to blocks:

# Stone
. Grass
^ Rock

w Short Player, Up (North)
s Short Player, Down
a Short Player, Left
d Short Player, Right

| Tall Player, Up
/ Tall Player, Down
- Tall Player, Left
_ Tall Player, Right

i Stair, Up
k Stair, Down
j Stair, Left (Stair heads left)
l Stair, Right

v Vent

b Box Unit
o Ball

m Mine
t Turret (yet to be implemented)

x Endpoint

My apologies if this mapping is absolutely ridiculous.
